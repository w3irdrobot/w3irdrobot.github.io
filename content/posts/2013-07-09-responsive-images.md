Recently, I had to make a small landing page for a client [at my job][1]. I had never done anything with responsive design. So, this became a chance for me to learn something new and fun! A big problem I was having was getting the height to scale with the width.

After some googling, I discovered the answer was one small line of code. Check it out below and, as always, let me know if this helped!

```css
img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}
```
